"§ - zero bed day cases. In the HES data, day cases are identified by a field called patient classification. There are a number of records which are not recorded as day cases, and appear as ordinary admissions, but which do not involve an overnight stay and do not result in another episode of care at the same provider.
These include a number of records which resulted in the death of the patient, or their transfer to another hospital provider, however the vast majority are recorded as having been discharged from hospital.

"NHS England has made changes to its internal structure as part of its Organisational Change Programme 2014/15. These changes came into effect in April 2015.

As part of this process NHS England’s area teams were integrated into the four existing regional teams: London, Midlands and East, North and South, each maintaining a local presence. Although we have changed our internal structure, NHS England remains one organisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
