"ยง - zero bed day cases. In the HES data, day cases are identified by a field called patient classification. There are a number of records which are not recorded as day cases, and appear as ordinary admissions, but which do not involve an overnight stay and do not result in another episode of care at the same provider.
These include a number of records which resulted in the death of the patient, or their transfer to another hospital provider, however the vast majority are recorded as having been discharged from hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
